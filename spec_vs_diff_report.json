  "summary": "The diff modifies CompressPDFTool.tsx to add a 'High Compression' mode alongside the existing 'Standard' mode. The implementation covers nearly all REQ-32 requirements: two compression levels, aggressive image downsampling for High mode (600px max / 45% JPEG quality), metadata stripping for both modes, useObjectStreams: true, before/after size display, percentage reduction, a 'could not compress further' message, and a download button for both levels. The file-summaries confirm all these features.",
