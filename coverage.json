        "summary": "Add a 'High Compression' mode option to the Compress PDF tool in `frontend/src/components/tools/CompressPDFTool.tsx`. The tool must present two selectable compression levels: 'Standard' (existing behavior) and 'High'. When 'High' is selected, apply more aggressive compression: downsample all embedded images to a lower resolution (e.g., max 72 DPI equivalent) and encode them at lower JPEG quality (e.g., quality 0.4–0.5 instead of the standard ~0.7), strip all metadata fields (Title, Author, Subject, Keywords, Creator, Producer), and save with `useObjectStreams: true`. Display the selected compression level label in the UI, and after processing show the before/after file sizes and percentage reduction. If the compressed file is not smaller than the original, inform the user that the file could not be reduced further. The download button must offer the compressed file regardless of compression level selected.",
